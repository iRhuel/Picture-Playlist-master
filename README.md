# Picture Playlist

This afternoon the objective is to utilize two API's, an image to text converter, and a music based API to grab songs that match that image. The web application should proceed as follows:

### Level 1
The first level should consist of an initial scaffolding of the web application. At this point, the application should be collecting data from both API's

### Level 2:
The second level consists of the main logic and mechanics of the user's side of the interface. At this point, you should have a wireframe and layout.

### Level 3:
The third level will replace a hard-coded set of images with a url that a user will input. A user should be click an analyze button and have it generate a playlist.

### Level 4:
The fourth level consists of allowing the user to query multiple images and a playlist based on multiple keywords.

## Conclusion
The specification is otherwise open-ended to allow you to focus on whatever part of the problem interests you. For example:

* You may choose the layout and style of the interface.
